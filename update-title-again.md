And then the battle's not so bad? Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.

It must be wonderful. And why did 'I' have to take a cab? __I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.__ *Yes, I saw.* You were doing well, until everyone died.

## Headline 2

Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. Really?! Who are those horrible orange men? Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

1. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!
2. Who am I making this out to?
3. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.

### And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.

Soon enough. I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. No, she'll probably make me do it. You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!

* You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!
* Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!
* We're also Santa Claus!

I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! Meh. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor.

You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored.

I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?

Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.

I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. Daylight and everything. With gusto. But existing is basically all I do!

Leela's gonna kill me. Who are those horrible orange men? Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Large bet on myself in round one.

Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!

Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!

No! Don't jump! That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!

Oh, I think we should just stay friends. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.

Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon. Leela's gonna kill me. Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Fry, we have a crate to deliver.
# For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!

And then the battle's not so bad? Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.

## Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved.

I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!

Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!

No! Don't jump! That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!

Oh, I think we should just stay friends. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.

Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon. Leela's gonna kill me. Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Fry, we have a crate to deliver.
# For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!

And then the battle's not so bad? Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.

It must be wonderful. And why did 'I' have to take a cab? __I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.__ *Yes, I saw.* You were doing well, until everyone died.

## Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved.

Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. Really?! Who are those horrible orange men? Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

1. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!
2. Who am I making this out to?
3. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.

### And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.

Soon enough. I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. No, she'll probably make me do it. You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!

* You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!
* Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!
* We're also Santa Claus!

I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! Meh. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor.

You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored.

I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?

Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.

I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. Daylight and everything. With gusto. But existing is basically all I do!

I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! Meh. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor.

You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored.

I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?

Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.

I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. Daylight and everything. With gusto. But existing is basically all I do!

Leela's gonna kill me. Who are those horrible orange men? Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Large bet on myself in round one.

Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!

Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!

No! Don't jump! That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!

Oh, I think we should just stay friends. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.

Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon. Leela's gonna kill me. Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Fry, we have a crate to deliver.
# For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!

And then the battle's not so bad? Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.

It must be wonderful. And why did 'I' have to take a cab? __I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.__ *Yes, I saw.* You were doing well, until everyone died.

## Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved.

Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. Really?! Who are those horrible orange men? Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

1. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!
2. Who am I making this out to?
3. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.

### And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.

Soon enough. I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. No, she'll probably make me do it. You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!

* You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!
* Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!
* We're also Santa Claus!
